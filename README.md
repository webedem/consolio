# Consolio
##A cloud console in your Google Chrome browser

###Overview

Consolio is an open-source cloud console. 

If you are a developer, you can build your own functions in JS and any server-side scripting language you want. 

You will need a package.json file for installing your command (sample here: http://www.consolio.co/packages/sample-package.json) and your JS file which will contain the default constructor and your custom functions (sample here: http://www.consolio.co/packages/demo.js)

You can install external functions by referencing the package.json URL of that function.

#####Current version is 0.2.0 nightly


###Available external functions:
