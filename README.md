# consolio
Consolio is an open-source cloud console were you can install external functions.

JQuery based web console, with some build-in functions. 
You can create your own functions in any scripting language you want 
(check the function_development folder for details), define an installation JSON package 
and then install that function at your consolio instance.

You can test install a third-party function called styleme by typing (within your instance):

>install http://dev.startupbless.com/consolio/packages/styleme/package.json
